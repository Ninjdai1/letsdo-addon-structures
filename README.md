# Let's Do Addon: Structures

An addon for the Let's Do mod series that adds themed, let's do-like structures to the world.

Currently features:
* Meadow barn - find it in meadows biomes
* Illager camp - located in meadow forests

LDA: Structures is only required server-side (client-side is needed for singleplayer), as it only builds upon content already provided by the Let's Do mods.
